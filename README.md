# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the game.
2. Players take turns to input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2).
3. The game ends when one player wins by aligning three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Requirements
